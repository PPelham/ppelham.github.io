      <h1>Welcome to my Homepage!</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Technology is exciting and always changing. Must have a passion for it
        or what else would you have better to do? Always enjoyed technology,
        regardless of the the many forms it's taken over the years. My
        television programs, music, organizer, contacts, and even my flashlight
        can all be put in my pocket. But, that's not what this site is about.</p>
      <h2>What to expect</h2>
      <p>This site was designed in a short amount of time entirely by hand. A
        lot more work needs to be done and using a template probably would of
        made things look a lot better. In business, the first goal is to get up
        and running as fast as possible and not to worry about the details. The
        rest of the time is polishing and re-designing. For my first ad-hock
        content, I chose to put up information about myself, interests, and what
        I have done so far. Feel free to poke around. If you have any comments,
        feel free to email me.</p>
