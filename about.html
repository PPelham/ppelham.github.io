      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3> Education </h3>
      <p> My technical education started back in High School with emphasis in
        Mathematics, Computer Programming, and Electronics and carried over into
        college in the field of Computer Sciences where I received my B.A.
        degree, and then beyond that with most of my growth being self taught
        while keeping up with new technologies. I've always been into tech as it
        allows me to express myself. </p>
      <h3> Hobbies &amp; Interests </h3>
      <p> In my spare time I enjoy working on my computer, tinkering with
        electronics, and programming. I also enjoy working on puzzles including
        <a href="https://www.killersudokuonline.com/">killer sudoku</a> puzzles
        which are my favorite, and playing Microsoft Flight Simulator. I also
        maintain and repair my bicycles and ride as my only form of
        transportation. </p>
      <h3> Aspirations </h3>
      <p> I hope one day to fill an operations adminstrator role which allows me
        to flex my analytical and troubleshooting skills. Will write more about
        this in the work section. </p>
